 - Minimize RMSE, can be used as fitness
 - GA params.: population size, generation number, crossover rate, mutation rate, etc.

The Simple Genetic Algorithm

The Crowding Concept
 - Extend SGA
 - Measure variation (entropy)

Fitness Functions and Tasks
 - Sine function (maximize)
 - Feature selection
    - ML algorithm (RMSE)


Theory Questions:
 - Niching?
 - diff genotype and fenotype?
 - other questions might be asked
